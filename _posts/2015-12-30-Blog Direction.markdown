Classes are finally done for the fall semester! I would have liked to update this blog more, but with finals and then the holidays, I never had a chance.

Anyway, now that I have time, I was thinking about how I wanted to structure this blog. I program daily and usually end up doing some interesting problems so I think I will write a "Problem of the Week" kind of thing each Monday or Sunday, similar in style to my first blog post. I'll probably make a few extra entries to make up for the slow December. I've also been working on a personal project of mine, a Bejeweled bot. I'll likely make a separate post about it later.

Basically you can expect:

- Programming commentary on interesting short problems
- Side projects
- Game modding/programming

Thanks for reading!
